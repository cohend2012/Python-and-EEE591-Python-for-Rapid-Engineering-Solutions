# Why lambda? Because the value given to command is executed immediately.
# As a result, if we said command=show_entry_fields(e1,e2), the e1 and e2
# would be evaluated immedately and then not again. Alternatively, we could
# do this: command=show_entry_fields and that's it. However, then e1 and e2
# have to be referenced in the function as global variables and that's
# bad practice. So, instead, we use lambda!
# Another way to look at this is command wants the "name" of the function
# to call. By using lambda, we fool it into allowing us to pass arguments.
